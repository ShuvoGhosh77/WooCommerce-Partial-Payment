# WooCommerce Partial Payment Plugin

This WooCommerce plugin adds support for **Partial Payments** on checkout. It allows the admin to define a partial payment percentage and gives customers the option to pay only a portion of the total amount during checkout. The remaining due is displayed and recorded in the order details for both the admin and customer.

  Add a new field in **WooCommerce > Settings > General** to define the **Partial Payment (%)**.
  
- **Partial Payment Option on Checkout Page**  
  Display a **checkbox** at checkout that allows customers to opt-in for partial payment.  
  When selected, the cart total is updated to reflect the partial payment amount.

- **Order Summary on Thank You Page**  
  After payment, on the **Order Received (Thank You) page**, the customer will see:  
  - **Total Price**  
  - **Partial Payment Amount**  
  - **Due Payment Amount**

- **Admin Order Overview**  
  In the **WooCommerce Orders table**, the admin can view:  
  - **Partial Payment Amount**  
  - **Due Payment Amount**
